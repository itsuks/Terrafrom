Terraform Terminologies:
-------------------------
1. Providers: 
   *) A provider is a plugin for terraform that defines and manages resources on a cloud or infrastructure plateform. 
   *) It helps terraform to understand where it has to create the resources.
   *) Providers includes three tiers:
          official: azure, aws and gcp
          partner: alibaba and oracle
          community: includes all other providers manages by terraform community.

2. Resource: 
  *) A resource is a specific infrastructure component that we want to create and manage using terraform.
  *) Resources can include virtual machines, databases, storage buckets, network components, etc.


3. Configuration files:
   *) Terrafor uses Configuration files to define the desired infrastructure state.
   *) It provides detail and definitions of providers, resources, variables and other settings.
   *) The primary configuration file is usually named as main.tf, but we can use multiple configuration files.
   *) The files are of .tf extension.


4. Variables:
   *) Variables in terraform are placeholders for values that can be passed into our configuration files.
   *) They make our code more flexible and dynamic and reusable by allowing us to define values outside of your code and pass them in when you apply the terraform configuration.


5. Output:
   *) Output are values generated by terraform after the infrastructure has been created or updated.
   *) Outputs are typically used to display information pr provide values to other parts of your infrastructure stacks.


6. Plan: 
   *) A terraform plan is a preview of changes that terraform will make to your infrastructure.
   *) When we run terraform plan, terraform analyzes your configurations and current state, then generates a plan detailing what actions it will take during the apply.

  
7. Apply:
   *) The terraform apply command is used to execute the changes specified in the plan.
   *) It creates, updates or destroyes resources based on the terrafom configuration.
